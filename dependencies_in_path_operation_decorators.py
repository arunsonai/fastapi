"""Dependencies in path operation decorators¶
In some cases you don't really need the return value of a dependency inside your path operation function.

Or the dependency doesn't return a value.

But you still need it to be executed/solved.

For those cases, instead of declaring a path operation function parameter with Depends, you can add a list of
dependencies to the path operation decorator.

Add dependencies to the path operation decorator¶
The path operation decorator receives an optional argument dependencies.

It should be a list of Depends():"""

# Remember to import Header and HTTPException from fastapi
async def verify_token(x_token: Annotated[str, Header()]):
    if x_token != "fake-super-secret-token":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=418, detail="X-token header Invalid")

async def verify_key(x_key: Annotated[str, Header()]):
    if x_key != "fake-super-secret-key":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=418, detail="X-Key header invalid")
    return verify_key

# Remember to import Depends from fastapi
@app.get("/items/", dependencies=[Depends(verify_token), Depends(verify_key)])
async def get_items():
    return [{"Murugan" : "God of War"}, {"Veerabaghu" : "Leader of Murugan Empire"}]

"""These dependencies will be executed/solved the same way as normal dependencies. But their
value (if they return any) won't be passed to your path operation function.
Using these dependencies in the path operation decorator you can make sure they are executed while avoiding editor/tooling errors.

It might also help avoid confusion for new developers that see an unused parameter in your code and could think it's unnecessary."""


"""Dependencies errors and return values¶
You can use the same dependency functions you use normally.

Dependency requirements¶
They can declare request requirements (like headers) or other sub-dependencies"""


"""Raise exceptions¶
These dependencies can raise exceptions, the same as normal dependencies"""


"""Return values¶
And they can return values or not, the values won't be used.

So, you can reuse a normal dependency (that returns a value) you already use somewhere else, and even
though the value won't be used, the dependency will be executed:"""


"""Dependencies for a group of path operations¶
Later, when reading about how to structure bigger applications (Bigger Applications - Multiple Files), possibly
with multiple files, you will learn how to declare a single 'dependencies' parameter for a group of path operations.

Global Dependencies¶
Next we will see how to add dependencies to the whole FastAPI application, so that they apply to each path operation."""
